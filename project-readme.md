Hey Luis,
Eventually I chose for the first option, cause I think it's going to be challenging 
enough for now. Made a plan, based on Jorge's plan. Probably left things out, so need to adjust it for sure. I hope to get a better overview on this along the way. Comments & suggestions are more than welcome :) 
Have a nice weekend!

## Description
In this game there's a pelican swimming in the lake. The player should move this pelican horizontally from one side to another. Above the pelican there's a sky full of twinkling stars. The stars are falling down one by one. The pelican must cath all the falling stars in his beak. The scoreboard shows how many stars the pelican managed to cath. One missed star, is end of game.
